\section{Genetic Algorithm Function}

The genetic algorithm works by mimicking the mechanism of chromosomes and genes in evolutionary biology. The algorithm works by creating a random `generation' of solutions to seed the iterative process. Each individual solution -- called a `chromosome' -- has a random solution to the problem at hand, at first. 

The iterative step of the process works by using a method to pick the fittest members of each generation and selecting them as parents for the next generation. Pairs of parents are `crossed over', where the parent solutions are co-mingled, and finally, a bit of randomness is added by `mutating' some of the solutions with random adjustments. The process then repeats, for a certain number of generations or until some fitness level is reached.
